<p>During my trip to Norway, we first landed in the capitol, Oslo. Oslo sits on
   a Fjord, and the city has a mixtureo of contemporary and European style buildings.
    From Oslo, we went to Bergen, a fishing city. There was a "Tall ships Race" going
    on in the city, and we walked around the city for a while. We ate at a fish market
    there, and I tried a raindeer burger, which I would not recommend. We then went
    on a train ride to Finse. Finse is pictured above, and it was beautiful. From Flam,
    we started our backpacking trip. We hiked thirty miles total from Flam to Osterbo.
    From there, we took a bus to Finse, which is a big cruise ship destination. We jumped
    off a bride there and swam in the foot of the Aurlandsfjord. The next day we started
    our kayaking journey. It was cold and raining the whole time, but still amazing. we
    passed a village that had a population of eighty-six people and 600 goats. The Norweigans
    are known for making a caramlized goat cheese, which is so good wow. I would highly
    recommend taking a trip to Norway.
